  <description>Typically, deconstructing a building or facility refunds roughly 75% of the raw materials that went into building it.

This mod changes the game to refund you 99% of the resources that went into your constructions. The game has a hardcoded limitation that requires at least one material each be lost in deconstruction.

[b]➸[/b] If you build and deconstruct an item that costs 50 steel and 2 components, you will get back 49 steel and 1 component.


HUGE thanks to BrokenValkyrie on the Ludeon forums for showing me the right way and writing the Harmony patch.



[h1]Would you rather have 100%?[/h1]
Use 99% with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1543064443]Deconstruct Return Fix[/url] along side to return everything!</description>
